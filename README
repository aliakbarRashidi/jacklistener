What is it?
===============
Jack Listener Daemon is a daemon that monitors ALSA jacks plugging/unplugging events and sends signals with these events to D-Bus.

Currently supported jacks are:
 - Headphones
 - Microphone
 - Line in/out
 - Video out

How to use it:
===============
If you use SysVinit, add script /etc/init.d/jacklistener to your default runlevel.

If you use systemd, run:
# systemctl enable jacklistener.service

If you use OpenRC (e.g. on Gentoo), run:
# rc-update add jacklistener default

The daemon starts after next boot, but you can start it manually.

How to compile:
===============
$ make
# make install

How to uninstall:
===============
# make uninstall
