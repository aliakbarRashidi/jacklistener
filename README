What is it?
===============
Jack Listener Daemon is a daemon that monitors ALSA jacks plugging/unplugging events and sends signals with these events to D-Bus.

Currently supported jacks are:
 - Headphones
 - Microphone
 - Line in/out
 - Video out

How to use it:
===============
If you use SysVinit, add script /etc/init.d/jacklistener to your default runlevel.

If you use systemd, run:
# systemctl enable jacklistener.service

If you use OpenRC (e.g. on Gentoo), run:
# rc-update add jacklistener default

The daemon starts after next boot, but you can start it manually.

How to compile:
===============
$ libtoolize
$ aclocal -I m4
$ autoheader
$ automake --add-missing
$ autoconf
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
$ make
# make install

If you are on Gentoo, you should use ebuild. It is located in directory 'gentoo'.
If you are on Archlinux, you should use PKGBUILD from AUR.
If you want init script or systemd unit, add '--enable-lsb' or '--enable-systemd' to configure line.
